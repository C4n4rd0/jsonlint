# How to Open JSON Files

## Creating a JSON File

To harness the full potential of **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** files or to use JSON viewers effectively, it's essential to first understand how to create one. JSON files have a .json extension and are extremely easy to script using a compatible text editor. Here's a simple guide on crafting a JSON file from scratch.

To pave the way, let's embark on the journey of creating our sample JSON file.

-   Open a text editor on your computer.
-   Create a new file with a .json extension.
-   Proceed by copying the sample JSON code provided below, pasting it into your newly created file.

Your final product should look something like this sample JSON code:

```
{
	"firstName": "fname",
	"lastName": "lname",
	"gender": "male",
	"age": 25,
	"address": {
	"streetAddress": "26 colony",
	"city": "Ahemdabad",
	"state": "Gujarat",
	"postalCode": 354323
},
"phoneNumbers": 
	[
		{
			"type": "business",
			"number": "9323227323"
		}
	]
}
```

Be sure to save your alterations. You've just created your first JSON file successfully!

Aside from being a standard type of data interchange format, JSON has broad utility. It's often utilized to transmit data from a web application to a server, take data backups, and vice versa. To put it simply, JSON is a flexible and compact format for data storage and exchange within web applications, and its broad compatibility with various devices and platforms only adds to its appeal for developers.

## How to open a JSON file?

One question that often arises is how to open a JSON file. This can be particularly confusing if you're unfamiliar with the process. Don't worry though, it's not half as daunting as it initially seems.

Firstly, it's important to remember that **JSON files are compatible with a multitude of programming languages** and databases, making them versatile and widely used for data interchange between web servers and applications. They're identified by their extensions - files carrying a .json extension are, you guessed it, JSON files.

One of the simplest ways to open a JSON file is by using a readymade tool, such as a [**JSON Lint**](https://jsonlint.com). JSON Lint allows you to conveniently open, view, edit, and decipher the data contained in a JSON file right on your device.

Here's a quick rundown of the JSON Lint's main features:

1.  **JSON Viewer:** Select and open any JSON file from your device.
2.  **JSON formatter:** Effortlessly turn your JSON files into a nicely formatted and easier to read version.

## Uses of JSON Format

The advanced applications of JSON files have stretched way beyond their primary purpose of transmitting data between servers and web applications. Initially, JSON files solely catered to the exchange of data between the web application and server. The format has since popularized, adapting to myriad purposes.

NoSQL database engines such as **MongoDB** and **Elasticsearch**, extensively utilize the JSON structure. They leverage this format to house unstructured data in their databases. This factor adds another feather to JSON files' cap as it has become the widely accepted format in the usage spectrum of the NoSQL Database.

If we nudge towards server-based JavaScript applications like node.js or reactJS, they too embody the JSON element for storing their configuration information. This mechanism allows an easy and structured pattern of data recall, bolstering the operational efficiency of the applications.

Digging further into the DNA of a JSON file, it follows an elementary rule of storing data and objects in the JSON format, which is, in reality, a globally-standard format to retain and exchange data. The simplicity of a JSON file gets highlighted as users can mould it with the .json extension and it does not consume much storage space. Moreover, it's a text-based and human-readable file, meaning any compatible text editor can read and edit it.

## Benefits of Using JSON Format

JSON files are versatile and easily adaptable. They're known for their compatibility with various programming languages. This format works well with JavaScript applications such as Node.js and ReactJS, alongside NoSQL database engines like MongoDB and Elasticsearch. This compatibility and usability have propelled JSON to be one of the widely-used file formats in programming.

One interesting feature of JSON is its compatibility with editors across the spectrum. For instance, [**Notepad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), a source code editor, fully supports JSON along with languages like C++, Java, YAML, and HTML. Loaded with an efficient interface and plugins for added functionality, Notepad++ is a tool to reckon with when dealing with JSON. Other supported file types include TXT, AS, CMD, CS, CSS, DIZ, HTML, JSON, and so on.

If we talk about accessibility, JSON files win here as well. Believe it or not, you can open your JSON files in browsers like [**Microsoft Edge**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge). The browser not only detects JSON files but also formats and syntax highlights them automatically. Microsoft Edge's JSON viewing capability sets it apart and provides a great UX for developers and non-developers alike.

However, even world-class tools like this can't magically fix invalid JSON data. Examples of such invalidities include omitting double quotes around key names and trailing commas after the last key-value pair. But do not fear, your handy [JSON viewer](https://jsonlint.com) won't leave you in the dark! It does apply syntax highlighting to invalid JSON and reports the errors conveniently in the Console tool.

Clearly, the benefits of JSON are hard to ignore. The simplicity, versatility, and widespread use make JSON files an asset in the digital era. No wonder they continue to impact and influence the way data is handled and transmitted in today's technologically driven world.
